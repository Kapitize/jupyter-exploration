# jupyter-exploration
This lab session was learning the basic use of Jupyter or Google Colab and on how to use Github and the desktop version.
Started with creating a GitHub account and getting started to using GitHub. Then learned on how to create a notebook then using the basic functions like adding cells and inputing text. Following on how to excecute each cell. From there we had to install GitHub desktop and upload the file from there. This was a very useful assignment as I am more comfortable in operating these functions.
